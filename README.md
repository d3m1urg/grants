# Grants.js

Grants.js is a simple yet powerful way of managing entitlements in a distributed environment. It lets you manage user entitlements through complicated JSON structures, which can inherit their options from multiple sources.
Grants.js is built with OpenID Connect / JWT / JWK infrastructure in mind and is mostly intended for use in web services environment.
Current implementation contains entitlements compilation engine, compliance engine and entitlements JSON schema.
Grants.js is under development now, API is a subject to change without any notice.
